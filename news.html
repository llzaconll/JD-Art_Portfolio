                exhibitions to gain new admirers. To this end I’d like to acknowledge my new collectors - I am extremely
                excited for the works to embark on the next chapter in your part of the world, and look forward to
                sharing my journey as an artist with you.

        <div id="n32">
            April saw the exhibit of a few of my originals in Austria at the lovely Galerie Kovacek & Zetter, Fine Art &
            Contemporary. This spring exhibition came to a close on the 16 April. The original pieces that were on
            display were Ritual, Venus and Guardian.
            <br><br>
            If you were unable to make that exhibition there is the chance to catch the works in the upcoming month at
            Art Austria which runs from the 5 - 8 May.

            My newest work Sanctuary is officially completed and is now available as a print. This print has turned out
            to be one of my favourited prints to date. I have been particularly interested in historical references
            lately, and a reinterpretation of the Three Graces found its way into this work.
            <br><br>
            I t is currently available as a special preorder edition where the first 10 will come with a hand-made
            etching, made in studio as the maiden etchings of the in-house printing press which I am also really excited
            about.
            <br><br>
